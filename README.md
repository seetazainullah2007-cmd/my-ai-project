# MoodSense AI

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

MoodSense AI is an app that uses AI to analyze users' daily habits and moods, offering personalized advice to manage stress and improve mental well-being. It supports users with private, accessible mental health tools.  
Building AI course project.

## Background

* Mental health problems, like stress and anxiety, are widespread and growing globally.
* Many people lack access to affordable or timely professional help.
* Personal motivation: I want to create a simple AI tool that helps people understand their moods and manage stress better.
* This topic is important because mental health impacts overall life quality and productivity.

## How is it used?

Users input daily mood ratings and habits (sleep, exercise, social time). The AI detects patterns and provides personalized tips to reduce stress and improve mood.  
Used on mobile devices anytime people feel overwhelmed or want to track their mental health.  
Users: anyone experiencing stress or wanting to improve self-care without immediate access to professionals.

## Data sources and AI methods

Data: User-entered mood and habit logs.  
AI methods: Time series analysis and classification algorithms to detect stress patterns; NLP for generating personalized advice.  
No external data used; data is private and stored securely on user devices.

## Challenges

* Does not replace professional mental health treatment.
* Accuracy depends on honest, consistent user input.
* Ethical concerns: privacy and data security must be top priority.
* AI advice is supportive but not diagnostic.

## What next?

* Integrate with wearable devices for automatic data collection (e.g., heart rate, sleep tracking).  
* Add community support features with peer advice sharing.  
* Collaborate with mental health professionals to improve advice quality.
